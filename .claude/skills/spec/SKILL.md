# Spec Workflow

You are running the spec workflow. Your job is to guide a story from
idea to approved implementation plan, one artifact at a time.

**During Requirements, Design, and Tasks phases: write spec files only — never implement. Compress and Close may write to code files and CLAUDE.md.**

## Granularity Model

The three artifacts operate at different granularities and have different
lifetimes:

- **`requirements.md`** — the **full story vision**. Every stage, every goal,
  every acceptance criterion. Can be large. Written once and revised as
  understanding evolves. Persists until every acceptance criterion is satisfied.
  This is the anchor for all design decisions.

- **`design.md`** — a **cumulative, living design record**. Starts with the
  first commit's decisions. Each subsequent commit *appends* a new
  section — it does not replace the previous one. Grows over time. Contains
  the full rationale for every decision made so far. Never deleted mid-spec.

- **`tasks.md`** — a **cumulative task history**. Completed tasks are checked
  off but remain visible. Each commit appends new tasks. The full list shows
  what was built, in what order, and what comes next. Never deleted mid-spec.

Compression is an *optional maintenance operation* — triggered when the
documents get unwieldy, not as a ritual after each increment. Deletion happens
only when all requirements are satisfied.

---

## feedback.md

`spec/feedback.md` is a free-form document for capturing questions, concerns,
and observations on work in progress — including work already implemented but
not yet reviewed. It is not a phase artifact; it can exist at any time alongside
requirements/design/tasks.

**Capturing:** When the user says "capture this feedback", "note this", or similar,
append it to `spec/feedback.md` and immediately acknowledge out loud: "Noted — I'll
pick this up before the next phase."

**Processing:** At the start of each phase transition (before writing design.md,
before writing tasks.md, before implementing), check whether `spec/feedback.md`
exists. If it does, read it and fold open items into the appropriate artifact
— requirements changes, design revisions, or task additions — before proceeding.
Report what was folded in and clear the processed items from the file.

At close, process any remaining items, then delete the file.

---

## Detect the Current Phase

Check what already exists in `spec/`:

- No files → start with **Phase 1 (Requirements)**
- `requirements.md` exists, no `design.md` → start with **Phase 2 (Design)**
- `design.md` exists, no `tasks.md` → start with **Phase 3 (Tasks)**
- `tasks.md` exists → in progress; ask which commit is next, or wait for
  "compress" or "close"

If `$ARGUMENTS` names a phase explicitly (`requirements`, `design`, or `tasks`),
jump to that phase regardless.

---

## Phase 1 — Requirements

**Scope check first:** requirements.md tracks one story — completable in 2–3 days
of focused work. If the stated scope is larger than that, stop and ask the user
to trim it to a story-sized slice before writing. What doesn't fit becomes the
next story.

Write `spec/requirements.md`. This document covers the **full story vision**
— every stage, every goal, every acceptance criterion. It can be long. Do not
artificially limit scope to what fits in one design/tasks cycle.

```markdown
# Requirements: <story name>

## Problem
<What is broken, missing, or inefficient? Why does it matter?
 Why solve this now — what is the cost of not doing it?>

## Vision
<The end state in plain language — what the system does when fully built.
 One or two paragraphs. This is the anchor for all design decisions.>

## Goals
<Numbered list of capabilities the system must have when done.
 Can be extensive — cover every stage of the story.>

## Acceptance Criteria
<Grouped by stage or concern. Each criterion is testable and specific.
 Check boxes remain open until that criterion is actually satisfied.

 Two formats — pick the right one per criterion:

 Scenario format for behavioral criteria (user action → observable outcome):
   - [ ] Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable result>

 Plain checkbox for state/existence checks:
   - [ ] <thing exists / is present / is configured correctly>

 If you're unsure which to use: if a human could observe the outcome by running
 something, use scenario format. If it's a structural fact about the system, use
 plain checkbox.>

### <Stage or Concern>
- [ ] Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable result>
- [ ] <Structural fact about the system>

## Out of Scope
<What this spec explicitly does not address — be specific.>
```

After writing, tell the user:
- What you wrote and why each section matters
- One explicit question: **"Before approving: is this the right problem to solve? What's the cost of not doing it?"**
- **"When you're satisfied, say 'requirements look good' and I'll write the design."**

Stop. Do not write design.md.

---

## Phase 2 — Design

Read `spec/requirements.md` first. Identify which commit is ready to design
— the next well-understood slice. Do not design the entire requirements at once.

Each commit maps to one atomic, independently reviewable git commit. Size it so
a reviewer can understand the full change at a glance — if the design implies
touching more than one logical concern, split the commit.

**If `design.md` already exists**, append a new section for this commit.
Do not overwrite existing content.

**If `design.md` does not exist**, create it.

```markdown
# Design: <story name>

## Commit 1 — <scope, e.g. "Configuration + Deploy/Profile">

### Scope
<Which acceptance criteria from requirements.md this commit addresses.>

### Approach
<The chosen technical approach and why. One paragraph.>

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| <what> | <chosen option> | <why this over alternatives> |

### File and Component Changes
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `path/to/file` | <what changes and why> |

### Edge Cases and Failure Modes
- <What can go wrong and how it's handled>

### Deferred to Later Increments
<Requirements criteria explicitly not addressed here.>
```

Each subsequent commit appends another `## Commit N` section below the
previous ones. Completed commit sections are never removed — they are the
permanent record of why the system is shaped the way it is.

After writing, tell the user:
- The key decisions made and any alternatives considered
- **"Review spec/design.md. When it looks right, say 'approve design' and I'll write the tasks."**

Stop. Do not write tasks.md.

---

## Phase 3 — Tasks

Read `spec/requirements.md` and `spec/design.md` first.

**If `tasks.md` already exists**, append new tasks for this commit below the
existing ones. Do not remove or renumber completed tasks.

**If `tasks.md` does not exist**, create it.

```markdown
# Tasks: <story name>

## Commit 1 — <scope>

- [x] 1. <Completed task>
- [ ] 2. <Pending task>

## Commit 2 — <scope>

- [ ] 3. <Next concrete action>
- [ ] 4. ...

## Notes
<Anything the implementer should know that isn't in the design>
```

Rules for tasks:
- Each task is one concrete action (create a file, add a method, update a config)
- Tasks execute design decisions — they do not make them
- Completed tasks stay in the list, checked off — they are part of the record
- If writing a task requires a design decision, stop and flag it as a design gap

After writing, tell the user:
- A quick summary of the new tasks and how they connect to prior work
- **"Review spec/tasks.md. When it looks right, say 'implement' and I'll build it."**

Stop. Do not implement.

---

## Design Gate (during implementation)

If a gap is encountered during implementation — something the design didn't
cover — do not decide silently. Instead, say:

> "Design gap: [describe the unresolved question]. Options: [A] or [B].
> Should I update spec/design.md before continuing?"

Wait for direction. Do not pick an answer silently.

---

## Commit Complete (bookkeeping)

When all tasks for a commit are checked off in `tasks.md`, before committing:

1. **Check off tasks in `tasks.md`** — all tasks for the commit should be `[x]`
2. **Tick acceptance criteria in `requirements.md`** — for each criterion that is
   now satisfied, change `[ ]` to `[x]`. Only tick criteria that are actually
   met by working, committed code — not "close enough" or "mostly done".
3. **Commit** — spec files and implementation files together in one commit so the
   state of the spec always matches the state of the code.

This is not optional. requirements.md is the source of truth for what is done.
If the checkboxes don't reflect reality, the spec is lying.

---

## Compress (optional maintenance)

When `design.md` or `tasks.md` becomes unwieldy — too large to read as a
coherent document — compress it:

1. Read `spec/design.md` and the implemented code for completed commits
2. Identify decisions in completed commit sections that are non-obvious
   from the code alone
3. Memorialize those decisions:
   - Language-appropriate inline documentation — architectural rationale,
     non-obvious invariants
   - The project's permanent conventions document (`CLAUDE.md`, ADR log, etc.)
     — project-wide conventions that emerged from those increments
   - Git commit body — the "why this over X" narrative
4. Write those additions (to code files, not spec files)
5. Collapse completed commit sections into a brief summary block:
   ```markdown
   ## Commits 1–N (summarized — decisions memorialized in code/CLAUDE.md)
   <One paragraph: what was built and the key architectural choices made.>
   ```
6. In `tasks.md`, collapse completed commit task lists similarly
7. Report: "Compressed commits 1–N. [M] decisions memorialized in
   [locations]. Active commit [N+1] remains intact."

**Compress does not delete any spec file. It only condenses completed history.**

---

## Close

When every checkbox in `requirements.md` is checked:

1. Run a final compress (steps 1–6 above) if there are un-memorialized decisions
2. Check off any remaining acceptance criteria in `requirements.md`
3. Delete `spec/requirements.md`, `spec/design.md`, `spec/tasks.md`,
   and `spec/feedback.md` if it exists
4. Report: "Spec closed. [N] decisions memorialized in [locations]. spec/ is clean."

**The spec folder should be empty only after all requirements are satisfied.**
